#  Washington State's Guide to Betting on Sports

Washington is a state with a rich history of betting on sports. Whether it's the Seahawks, Mariners, or Huskies, Washingtonians love to put their money down on the games. With that in mind, we've put together this guide to betting on sports in Washington.

First and foremost, you'll need to find a reputable sportsbook. There are plenty of options in Washington, but not all of them are created equal. Make sure you do your research and find a book that has a good reputation and offers competitive odds.

Once you've found a sportsbook, it's time to start placing bets. The most popular sports to bet on in Washington are basketball, football, and baseball. However, you can also bet on other sports such as soccer, golf, and tennis.

When placing a bet, there are two main types to choose from: the point spread and the moneyline. With the point spread, the bookmaker assigns a margin of victory which they believe one team will beat the other by. This allows for more even odds between teams. The moneyline is simpler; it just awards money based on who wins the game outright.

There are also a variety of bets you can place within each type of wager. The most common are head-to-head bets (also known as "matchups"), where you pick one team to win against the other. You can also bet on totals (over/under), which is how many points will be scored in the game combined by both teams. Parlays allow you to combine multiple bets into one wager, while prop bets let you bet on specific aspects of the game such as who will score first or how many touchdowns will be scored.

No matter what sport you're betting on, there's something for everyone in Washington state when it comes to betting on sports!
