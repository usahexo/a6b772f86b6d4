#  Casino Royale: NewImproved Edition

Casino Royale is a classic movie that has been remade multiple times. The newest edition, released in late 2017, tries to stay true to the roots of the story while updating some of the rougher elements for a modern audience.

The basic plot is unchanged: A young Bond (played by Daniel Craig) is sent to defeat a villainous banker (played by Mads Mikkelsen) who is trying to destroy MI6. Along the way he falls in love with Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green), and beats Le Chiffre at his own game in a high stakes poker match.

The new Casino Royale improves on the original in several ways. First, it is more faithful to Fleming’s novel, which provides a richer backstory for Bond and Vesper. It also features better action sequences, thanks in part to director Martin Campbell’s experience directing Goldeneye and other Bond films. Finally, it features Craig’s best performance as 007 yet.

If you are a fan of James Bond movies or just good action thrillers, Casino Royale is definitely worth your time.

What makes the film so enjoyable is its over-the-top action sequences which are brilliantly executed. The opening scene in particular, which features a spectacular car chase through the streets of monaco, is enough to get your heart racing.
