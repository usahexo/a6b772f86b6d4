#  How to remove change from vending machine stuck in lieu slot Cyprus

Stuck coins are a common problem with vending machines, but they don't have to be a hassle. With a few simple steps, you can remove the change without causing any damage to the machine.

The first step is to try and dislodge the coin yourself. Reach into the coin slot and try to wiggle the stuck coin loose. If it doesn't come loose after a few tries, move on to the next step.

Next, you'll need a thin piece of metal or plastic. Try using a credit card or driver's license. Slide the metal or plastic into the coin slot and try to pry the coin loose. If it doesn't come loose after a few tries, move on to the next step.

The last resort is to use a screwdriver or other sharp object. Be very careful not to damage the machine when doing this. Insert the screwdriver into the coin slot and try to lever the coin out. If it doesn't come loose after a few tries, move on to the next step.

If none of these methods work, you may need to call a technician to fix the machine.

There are various ways to remove a change from a vending machine if it becomes stuck in the dispensing slot. While many of these methods may seem like common sense, they can nonetheless come in handy when one is in a bind.

One option is to shake the vending machine. This can often dislodge the coin and send it flying out of the dispensing slot. Another method is to try to wiggle or pry the coin out using a pen or other object. If these methods do not work, then some people have resorted to removing the entire front panel of the vending machine in order to get at the stuck coin.

Of course, before trying any of these methods, it is important to make sure that there is actually something blocking the dispensing slot. It may just be that the machine needs emptied or that there is a problem with the coin itself. In such cases, trying to forcibly remove the coin could end up causing more damage and result in further headaches.

This process requires a Phillips head screwdriver.

The first step is to remove the screws from the front of the machine.

Next, you need to pry open the front of the machine. Do this by inserting the screwdriver into the two small indentations at the bottom and prying up.

Once the front is open, you will be able to see the change tray. The tray can be pulled out by grabbing either side and pulling. If the coin mechanism is stuck in lieu of a slot, you will need to grab hold of it and pull it out as well.

If there is anything blocking the coins from falling through to the payout tray, use your screwdriver to remove it. Once everything is cleared, close the front of the machine and replace the screws.
