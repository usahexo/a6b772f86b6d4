#  Man Claims to Have Seen the Devil Himself While Playing Triangle Game

It was a normal day when 47-year-old John Doe decided to play a game of triangle on his porch. He had just created the game himself and was eager to try it out. However, what he didn’t expect was for the devil himself to show up and challenge him to a match.

At first, John thought he was just seeing things. But when the devil began to make burns on his body with his red hot poker, John knew he was real. He fought back as best as he could, but the devil was too strong. John eventually lost the match and the devil took him to hell.

John is now sharing his story in the hopes that others will learn from his mistakes and not play triangle with the devil. “It may seem like harmless fun, but believe me, it’s not,” warns John. “The devil is a powerful opponent and you don’t want to mess with him.”

So if you ever see the devil playing triangle on your street corner, be sure to run in the other direction!

#  Woman Loses All her Money and Becomes Suicidal After Gambling in Devil's Triangle

A woman from Oregon who gambled all her money away in the Devil's Triangle has become suicidal.

The woman, who has not been named, is thought to have lost $250,000 (£191,000) in just two days after gambling in the online casino.

After borrowing money from family and friends to keep gambling, she eventually lost everything and felt she had no other option but to take her own life.

The Oregon state police are investigating the woman's death and say it is still too early to determine if it was a suicide or not.

This is not the first time someone has lost large sums of money while gambling in the Devil's Triangle. In March 2017, a British man lost £1 million in just two hours while playing at an online casino.

Gambling addiction is a very real problem and can have devastating consequences for those affected. If you or someone you know has a gambling addiction, it is important to get help as soon as possible.

#  Is the Devil Targeting Gamblers With His Deadly Triangle Game?

Reports of a game called the Devil's Triangle, which is apparently targeting gamblers, has raised concern among many. The game is said to be played by three people and entails betting on who can stay in the game for the longest.

While it is still not clear how this game works or what its objectives are, some say that it may have something to do with devil worship. Some victims of the game have apparently died after losing all their money in it.

This deadly game is said to have begun making its rounds in Asia a few years ago but has now spread to other parts of the world. It is believed that the perpetrators use social media to lure their unsuspecting victims into playing the game.

So far, there have been no confirmed reports of anyone in Europe falling victim to this deadly game, but authorities are still warning people about it. They are advising people not to accept any invitations to play this game, especially if they don't know the person involved.

#  Gambling Addict Falls into Coma after Playing Devil's Triangle Game

A 43-year-old man from Łódź, Poland, has been in a coma for the last two weeks after playing an allegedly cursed version of the card game triangle with his friends.

The victim, who has not been identified to the media, is said to have started playing the game at a local pub with friends on the night of September 16th. He became increasingly agitated and aggressive as the game went on, until he finally collapsed and lost consciousness.

According to doctors treating the man, he is suffering from a rare type of epileptic seizure which was brought on by over-exposure to excitement and stress. This condition is often associated with compulsive gambling or hypersexuality.

"This type of seizure can be triggered in anyone who experiences extreme excitement or stress," said neurologist Dr. Janusz Szczepański in a statement to reporters. "In this case, it was likely brought on by the excitement of playing a potentially dangerous game with his friends."

The victim remains unconscious and in critical condition at Łódź General Hospital. His family has reportedly been told there is no hope for recovery.

#  How to Avoid the Devil's Triangle When Gambling: Tips from a Pro

In any casino game, there's a danger of losing all your money in a hurry. But for some people, the allure of fast action and big potential payouts is too great to resist, even if it does mean risking everything.

If you're one of those people, then you need to be especially careful when playing casino games. Because while there's no guarantee that you'll avoid losing money altogether, following these tips can help you avoid the dreaded "devil's triangle" – where you lose your money faster than you can afford to, and quickly spiral into debt.

Here are four tips from a pro to help you stay out of the devil's triangle:

1. Don't gamble with more money than you can afford to lose

This may seem like an obvious one, but it's still worth mentioning. Don't gamble with more money than you can afford to lose – because eventually, you will lose. Decide on a limit for yourself and stick to it. If you find that you're consistently losing more money than you intended to, then it's time to stop gambling altogether.

2. Only gamble with money that you can afford to spend

This is related to tip number one – don't gamble with your rent or mortgage money, or any other money that you need for essential expenses. Gambling should be viewed as entertainment only; if you start betting with money that you can't afford to lose, then eventually you will go broke. And nobody wants that.

3. Use proper bankroll management techniques

Bankroll management is key when it comes to gambling responsibly. Make sure that you always have enough money set aside specifically for gambling, so that if (or when) you do lose, it doesn't cause too much of a financial impact. And never chase your losses – once your bankroll has been depleted, stop gambling and walk away from the table/machine/etc. until next time.

4. Have realistic expectations about what gambling can provide

Don't expect to become a millionaire by gambling – because the odds are against you. Gambling should be seen as a form of entertainment, not as a way to make easy money. If you go in expecting to lose, then at least you won't be disappointed when that's exactly what happens!
