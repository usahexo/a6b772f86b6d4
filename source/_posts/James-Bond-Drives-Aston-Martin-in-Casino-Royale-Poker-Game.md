#  James Bond Drives Aston Martin in Casino Royale Poker Game

It has long been a staple of the James Bond franchise that the suave British secret agent drives an Aston Martin. In the 2006 movie Casino Royale, Bond takes his beloved Aston Martin through a high-stakes poker game.

In one memorable scene, Bond is all in on a final hand against his nemesis Le Chiffre. With queen high and Le Chiffre holding an Ace-King, it looks like Bond is about to be defeated. However, with a swift and skilled play, Bond elicits a call from Le Chiffre and wins the pot, much to the astonishment of his opponent.

The driving scenes in Casino Royale are some of the most exciting in the entire series. The Aston Martin DB9 is unquestionably the perfect car for 007, as it can handle both tight corners and high speeds with ease. Thanks to its luxury features and sleek design, the Aston Martin makes for the perfect getaway car when things go wrong.

Bond fans will no doubt be excited to see Daniel Craig return as 007 in the upcoming movie Spectre. In addition to returning to his role as a deadly spy, Craig will also be behind the wheel of an Aston Martin once again.

If you're looking for an exciting sports car that's perfect for cruising around town or tearing up the track, look no further than the Porsche 911 Carrera S.

In addition to its impressive looks and performance, the DB9 Volante also offers luxurious interior features like wood trim and power seats.

#  Bentley Continental GT Used in Casino Royale Poker Scene

Bentley Motors Limited is a British manufacturer of automobiles founded on 18 January 1919 by Walter Owen Bentley.

The company has its headquarters in Crewe, Cheshire, England. Bentley has been manufacturing cars since 1924.

In the early 21st century, Bentley produced the Continental GT, a sports car with a 6-litre W12 engine. The car was used in the poker scene of the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale.

The film's producers chose the Continental GT because they wanted a British car that would be internationally recognised. The car was also used in subsequent Bond films Quantum of Solace (2008) and Skyfall (2012).

In March 2018, Bentley announced that it would discontinue the Continental GT after 10 years of production. The company said that it would focus on electric and hybrid vehicles instead.
