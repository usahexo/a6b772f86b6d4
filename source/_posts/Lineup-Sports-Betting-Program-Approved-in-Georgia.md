#  Lineup Sports Betting Program Approved in Georgia

The governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, has approved a sports betting program that will allow betting on professional and collegiate sports. The program, which is set to launch in 2020, will be run by the state’s lottery system.

Georgia is the latest state to legalize some form of sports betting. In May, the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had prohibited most states from authorizing sports betting. Since then, several states have moved to legalize the activity.

Supporters of the new program in Georgia say it will bring new revenue to the state. They also argue that it will help keep gambling addiction in check by allowing people to bet on sports in a regulated environment.

Critics of the program say it could lead to corruption in college sports and make it more difficult for amateur athletes to compete. They also argue that the new revenue generated by sports betting will be outweighed by the costs associated with regulating and monitoring the activity.

How Lineup Sports Betting Program Works

Under the new program in Georgia, residents will be able to bet on professional and collegiate sporting events through the state lottery system. Bettors will be able to place bets online or through retail locations throughout the state. The minimum age for gambling is 21 years old.

The program will initially offer betting on football, basketball, baseball, and hockey games. In future expansions, additional sporting events may be added including college and professional football, basketball, and baseball games; as well as NASCAR races, golf tournaments, and other major sporting events.

Players must place a minimum wager of $2 in order to participate in the program. The maximum bet allowed per game is $500. Winnings up to $5,000 can be collected without having to file a tax return; however any winnings over $5,000 must be reported as taxable income.

In order to ensure fairness and prevent corruption, players will not be able to bet on any games involving their favorite team or any other team they have a personal connection with. Games involving colleges located within 100 miles of Georgia are also not eligible for betting under the program.

#  Georgia Gaming Commission greenlights new sports betting program

The Georgia Gaming Commission has given the go ahead to a new sports betting program that will be operated by the state’s lottery system. The new program, which is expected to launch in early 2020, will allow Georgians over the age of 21 to place bets on professional and collegiate sporting events.

Fans of legal sports betting in the Peach State will likely be happy with this news, as they have been awaiting a sports betting program since the US Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting in 2018. The Georgia Gaming Commission says that it plans to offer a variety of betting options through its new program, including straight bets, parlays, teasers, and moneylines.

Georgians who want to participate in the state’s new sports betting program will need to visit one of the 27 authorized lottery retailers in order to make a bet. There is no word yet on what percentage of each bet will go to the state government, but officials say that more information on that front will be released in the coming months.

Supporters of the new sports betting program say that it will generate much-needed revenue for the state government, while opponents argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction rates. Whatever your opinion on Georgia’s new sports betting program, it is now officially official and set to debut early next year.

#  Sports betting officially arrives in Georgia with the launch of Lineup

In what is seen as a landmark move for the state of Georgia, sports betting has officially been launched in the form of a new app called Lineup.

The app, which is available to download now on both Android and iOS devices, offers users a range of betting options on both local and international sporting events. These include traditional sports like football and basketball, as well as more unusual options such as e-sports and darts.

Lineup is the result of a collaboration between two major companies in the gambling industry, Tabcorp Holdings Ltd. (ASX: TAH) and The Stars Group Inc. (TSX: TSGI), who merged their respective US operations earlier this year. The new app represents the first time that either company has offered its products in the state of Georgia.

PaulJupe, CEO of Tabcorp USA, said that Lineup was designed to provide a unique experience for players in Georgia.

“From our NFL bets to March Madness brackets, there’s something for everyone on Lineup. We can’t wait for fans to start using the app and explore all of the great features we have to offer.”

Tabcorp and The Stars Group are not alone in seeing potential in the Georgian market. In October last year, international gaming giant MGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM) announced plans to invest $130 million in a new integrated resort near Atlanta. The project, which is still awaiting regulatory approval, would include a casino with 2500 slot machines and 130 table games.
