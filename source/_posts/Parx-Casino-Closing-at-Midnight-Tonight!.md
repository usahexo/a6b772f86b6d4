#  Parx Casino Closing at Midnight Tonight!

Parx Casino, Pennsylvania's largest gaming destination, will close at midnight tonight according to the casino's website.

The closure is a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent government shutdown which has forced the casino to lay off its 2,000 employees.

"This is a very difficult day for all of us and we appreciate your understanding as we work through this unprecedented situation," said a statement on the Parx Casino website.

The casino is offering its employees help in finding new employment and has set up a hotline for those affected by the closure.

"We are committed to doing everything possible to support our employees during this difficult time," the statement said.

#  Parx Casino Opening at 7am This Morning!

The much-anticipated Parx Casino in Bensalem, PA is opening at 7am this morning! Doors open at 6:30am for those wanting to get a jump on the line. This casino is said to be one of the largest in the country, and it is expected to bring in a lot of business for the Philadelphia area.

The casino is located on 400 acres of land and has 3,000 slot machines, 125 table games, and a 16-table poker room. There is also a 14-story luxury hotel with 510 rooms. Restaurants in the casino include BR Prime Steakhouse, Bobby's Burger Palace, Cooper's Brick Oven Pizza, Noodle Bar, and SweetFrog frozen yogurt.

There are also several bars including The 360 Lounge and X Bar. The 360 Lounge overlooks the gaming floor and offers cocktails and light fare. X Bar is an ultra-lounge that features DJs, dancing, and regional beers.

Other amenities include a 2,500-seat arena for concerts and other events, a spa, and a fitness center.

Parx Casino is expecting to attract around 5 million visitors per year. It is hoped that this new casino will help to revive Philadelphia's economy which has been struggling in recent years.

#  Parx Casino Closing at 3am Tonight!

The soon-to-be shuttered Parx Casino in Bensalem, PA is set to close its doors for the final time at 3am this morning. The closure comes as a result of the casino's parent company, Greenwood Gaming and Entertainment, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month.

According to court filings, the casino owes more than $50 million to creditors and was not generating enough revenue to cover its costs. In addition to the casino, Greenwood also owns the Sands Casino in Bethlehem, PA and the Mohegan Sun Pocono in Wilkes-Barre, PA. All three casinos are set to close their doors in the coming weeks.

In a statement released earlier this week, Greenwood CEO Anthony Marino said that "the decision to close these properties was not easy but was made necessary by our current financial situation." He added that the company is "committed to working with our creditors and other stakeholders to emerge from Chapter 11 as a stronger organization."

News of the Parx Casino's impending closure has drawn mixed reactions from local residents. Some are sad to see it go while others say they're glad to see it fold given its poor track record.

The casino first opened its doors in 1976 and employed over 1,600 people. It was once one of the largest casinos in the country but had seen its business decline in recent years.

#  Parx Casino to Stay Open 24/7 Starting Tonight!

The Parx Casino, just outside Philadelphia, will be open all night starting from tonight, according to the casino's Facebook page. The casino is located in Bensalem Township, Bucks County.

This move by the Parx Casino is a bit of a surprise, as the casino typically closes at 2am. The casino stated on their Facebook page that they are responding to customer feedback and are permanently changing their hours to offer "the best gaming and entertainment experience possible."

Starting tonight, the Parx Casino will be open from 8pm until 4am. There will be live music performances and drink specials throughout the evening. In addition, there will be a variety of table games and slots available for players to enjoy.

The Parx Casino is one of the largest casinos in Pennsylvania, with over 125 table games and 3,500 slot machines. It is also home to the state's largest sportsbook.
