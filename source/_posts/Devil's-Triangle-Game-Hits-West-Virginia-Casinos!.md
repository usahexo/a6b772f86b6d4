This is a game that requires strategy, coordination, and plenty of thinking on your feet. The goal is to move all of the tokens from one side of the triangle to the other. The catch is that you can only move one token at a time, and you can't put a token back where it came from.

The game can be played with any number of players, but it's best with four or more. You'll need a triangle-shaped piece of paper (or cardboard) and some tokens or coins. Draw lines on the paper to create three sides of a triangle, then divide the triangle into nine sections as shown in the diagram below.


Each player starts with three tokens on one side of the triangle. Play passes clockwise around the table, and each player must either move a token according to these rules:
1. A token can only be moved if it is adjacent to another token.
2. Tokens cannot be moved diagonally.
3. A token cannot be moved if it would leave the triangle.
4. The player cannot put a token back where it came from.
or
roll the dice and follow the corresponding instructions:
1 Move one token forwards two spaces 
2 Move one token backwards two spaces 
3 Move one token left one space 
4 Move one token right one space 
5 Add anothertoken to your hand fromthe bank 
6 Exchange two tokens with another player 

If after moving, a player's token would land on a spot already occupied by another player'stoken, then that player'stoken is " blocked" and cannot be moved . In this case, both players must roll again for their next turn . If both players roll again , then they must exchange tokens .

When all of his or her tokens are off of his or her side of the triangle, the player wins! If at any point a player has no more moves possible, then that player loses . The first player to win three rounds wins the game!
