      		<h1 id="Federal-government-cracks-down-on-illegal-fantasy-sports-gambling"><a href="#Federal-government-cracks-down-on-illegal-fantasy-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Federal government cracks down on illegal fantasy sports gambling"></a>Federal government cracks down on illegal fantasy sports gambling</h1><p>The legality of fantasy sports has come under scrutiny in recent years as the industry has grown in popularity. A recent crackdown by the federal government has signaled that this form of gambling is not legal, after all.</p>
<p>Leading up to the crackdown, there was ambiguity over whether or not fantasy sports constituted illegal gambling. The key question was whether or not the outcome of a fantasy sports contest depended on chance rather than skill.</p>
<p>Now, it appears that the federal government has answered that question in the affirmative. In a recent letter to two top lawmakers, the Department of Justice stated that “fantasy sports are games of chance.”</p>
<p>This is a major development for the fantasy sports industry, which is expected to generate $4 billion in revenue this year. It also spells trouble for companies like FanDuel and DraftKings, which have built their businesses around offering contests that depend on chance.</p>
<p>Both companies have been hit with lawsuits in recent months alleging that their contests are illegal gambling operations. The letters from the DOJ are likely to embolden these suits and could lead to more litigation against the industry’s top players.</p>
<p>In addition to the legal troubles facing FanDuel and DraftKings, state regulators are also starting to take a closer look at fantasy sports contests. In New York, for example, regulators are investigating whether or not FanDuel and DraftKings should be required to obtain gambling licenses.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how all of this will play out for the fantasy sports industry. But one thing is clear: The days of unregulated fantasy sports betting are coming to an end.</p>
<h1 id="Fantasy-sports-bettors-could-face-jail-time"><a href="#Fantasy-sports-bettors-could-face-jail-time" class="headerlink" title="Fantasy sports bettors could face jail time"></a>Fantasy sports bettors could face jail time</h1><p>On Wednesday, July 26, Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, and Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, Ranking Member of the House Oversight Committee, sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions requesting that he investigate whether fantasy sports participants are violating the law.</p>
<p>“The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA) prohibits gambling businesses from knowingly accepting payments in connection with the participation of another person in a bet or wager that involves the use of the internet and that is unlawful under any federal or state law,” wrote Chaffetz and Cummings. “We request that you provide us with information about the Department’s enforcement of this prohibition against fantasy sports.”</p>
<p>In their letter, Chaffetz and Cummings note reports that some fantasy sports participants may be violating state laws prohibiting gambling. State laws vary on the legality of fantasy sports betting, but most states do not have specific laws regulating fantasy sports betting.</p>
<p>“State law regarding whether daily fantasy sports betting is legal is all over the place,” said World Sportswire legal analyst Daniel Wallach. “Some states specifically exempt daily fantasy sports from their anti-gambling statutes, while others don’t address it one way or another.”</p>
<p>Wallach added that there has been no federal case law on the issue to date. “Congress has never weighed in on this issue,” he said.</p>
<p>The UIGEA was passed in 2006 in an effort to crack down on online gambling. The law prohibits financial institutions from processing payments for online gambling transactions. The act does not specifically mention fantasy sports betting, but there is concern among some lawmakers that the act could be interpreted to prohibit fantasy sports betting as well.</p>
<p>Fantasy sports industry groups maintain that daily fantasy sports are not gambling and should not be subject to the same restrictions as other forms of gambling. In a statement released Wednesday, the Fantasy Sports Trade Association (FSTA) said it looked forward to working with Congress and the Department of Justice “to ensure that our industry operates within federal law.”</p>
<p>“Daily Fantasy Sports are contests of skill,” said FSTA CEO Peter Schoenke. “They have been around for more than a decade and are enjoyed by millions of people.”</p>
<p>Chaffetz and Cummings request information from Sessions on what steps the Department of Justice has taken to enforce the UIGEA against fantasy sports betting and what guidance DOJ has provided to financial institutions on processing payments for such activities.</p>
<h1 id="Attorney-General-announces-crackdown-on-illegal-online-sports-betting"><a href="#Attorney-General-announces-crackdown-on-illegal-online-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Attorney General announces crackdown on illegal online sports betting"></a>Attorney General announces crackdown on illegal online sports betting</h1><p>Today, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a crackdown on illegal online sports betting.</p>
<p>“The Department of Justice will not tolerate the flagrant violation of federal law in this sector,” said Sessions. “We will enforce the law vigorously against those who attempt to profit from the exploitation of American athletes and fans.”</p>
<p>Illegal online sports betting is a multi-billion dollar industry that hurts innocent people and corrodes the integrity of sporting events. The Department of Justice is committed to rooting out this illegal activity and protecting America’s athletes and fans.</p>
<h1 id="Is-online-fantasy-sports-gambling-legal"><a href="#Is-online-fantasy-sports-gambling-legal" class="headerlink" title="Is online fantasy sports gambling legal?"></a>Is online fantasy sports gambling legal?</h1><p>Online fantasy sports is a recent phenomenon that has taken the internet by storm. Gamblers can engage in contests where they create lineups of real players in order to score points based on their actual performances in real-life sporting events. The excitement and potential payoff for winning these contests has resulted in this activity growing exponentially in popularity over the last decade.</p>
<p>However, as is often the case with new activities that are quickly embraced by the public, there exists some confusion as to whether or not online fantasy sports gambling is legal. This article will provide an overview of both the legality of online fantasy sports gambling and how it is regulated in different parts of the world.</p>
<p>So what is the answer to the question – is online fantasy sports gambling legal? The answer to this question largely depends on where you reside. In most countries, online fantasy sport gambling is perfectly legal. However, there are a few countries, such as the United States, where it is considered unlawful. Let’s take a look at how each of these jurisdictions views online fantasy sports gambling.</p>
<p>In North America, Canada and the United States both consider online fantasy sports gambling to be illegal. In Canada, it is considered an illegal activity under Section 207 of the Criminal Code. The US takes a similar view, as online fantasy sports betting is classified as illegal under the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) which was passed back in 2006.</p>
<p>While online fantasy sports gambling is technically illegal in these countries, this has not stopped millions of people from engaging in this activity. In fact, given its popularity, it’s likely that law enforcement officials have more pressing issues to deal with and have chosen not to crackdown on those who partake in online fantasy sports betting.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while Canada and the US view online fantasy sports gambling as being illegal, both countries permit paid-entry fantasy sports contests where real money can be won. So if you want to engage in some legal online fantasy sports action, you could always try your hand at one of these paid-entry contests.</p>
<p>In contrast to North America, most other countries around the world do not consider online fantasy sports gambling to be a crime. Countries such as Australia, Belgium, Spain and Switzerland all have no issues with people engaging in this activity and it is generally unregulated. This means that there are no specific laws governing how these sites must operate or what age restrictions need to be put into place. As long as you are located outside of North America, you should have no problems participating in any online fantasy sports betting contests you please!</p>
<h1 id="Fantasy-football-players-could-be-breaking-the-law"><a href="#Fantasy-football-players-could-be-breaking-the-law" class="headerlink" title="Fantasy football players could be breaking the law"></a>Fantasy football players could be breaking the law</h1><p>Each year, millions of people engage in fantasy football, risking money on the outcome of simulated NFL games. Some players may be breaking the law, as they could be taking money from illegal gambling operations.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is a crime in all 50 states, and can lead to significant fines and even time in prison. So, why do people keep doing it?</p>
<p>“Gambling has always been an attraction because of the potential for large payoffs,” said Las Vegas criminal defense lawyer David Chesnoff. “But when you add in the element of risk, it becomes even more intoxicating.”</p>
<p>And that’s certainly true for fantasy football players. Many people put hundreds or even thousands of dollars on the line each season, hoping to win big.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is often run by organized crime syndicates, so it can be dangerous to get involved. Players can be scammed or robbed by the operators, or could even face violence if they cross the wrong people.</p>
<p>So why do people continue to gamble illegally? For many, it’s simply because the potential rewards are too great to pass up.</p>
