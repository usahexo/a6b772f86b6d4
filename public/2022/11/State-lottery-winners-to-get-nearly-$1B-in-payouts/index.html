        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="State-lottery-winners-to-get-nearly-1B-in-payouts"><a href="#State-lottery-winners-to-get-nearly-1B-in-payouts" class="headerlink" title="State lottery winners to get nearly $1B in payouts"></a>State lottery winners to get nearly $1B in payouts</h1><p>The state lottery is set to dish out nearly $1 billion in prize payouts across the country, with nine winners set to take home at least $1 million each.</p>
<p>Lottery officials say that ticket sales have been brisk in advance of tonight’s drawing, which is expected to produce a jackpot winner worth more than $370 million. The payouts will be spread among 44 states that participate in the lottery, with California leading the way with 18 winners.</p>
<p>The Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL) runs the Powerball game, and its members include 44 U.S. states, Washington D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands. MUSL sets the prize payout schedule for Powerball and other lotteries that it operates.</p>
<p>The second largest payout in Powerball history was a $564 million jackpot split by three winning tickets sold in January 2016. The largest single Powerball payout was a whopping $1.586 billion won by a ticket holder in January 2016. That prize was split between three winning tickets.</p>
<p>Powerball is played in 44 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and the U.S Virgin Islands. Jackpots start at $40 million and can grow rapidly if there are no winning tickets sold for several drawings in a row</p>
<h1 id="What-does-indeed-pa-do-with-all-typically-the-money-from-lottery-and-gambling-PlaysonDirect"><a href="#What-does-indeed-pa-do-with-all-typically-the-money-from-lottery-and-gambling-PlaysonDirect" class="headerlink" title="What does indeed pa do with all typically the money from lottery and gambling PlaysonDirect?"></a>What does indeed pa do with all typically the money from lottery and gambling PlaysonDirect?</h1><p>Lottery and gambling proceeds account for a significant source of revenue for many U.S. states. In fiscal year 2016, lottery and gaming revenues totaled $93 billion, of which an estimated $59.8 billion was from lottery sales and $33.2 billion was from casino gaming (1). In this article, we provide an overview of how states use lottery and gambling proceeds.</p>
<p>Most states use revenue from lotteries and gambling to support state services such as education, public health, and infrastructure. For example, in fiscal year 2016, New York used $3.6 billion in lottery and gambling proceeds to support education programs (2). A small number of states use a portion of lottery and gambling revenue to support services for people with gambling addiction or problem gambling behavior.</p>
<p>Some policymakers have raised concerns that too much revenue is earmarked for specific purposes such as education or health care, and not enough is available for general fund purposes such as paying for government operations or reducing taxes. For instance, in fiscal year 2016, Colorado dedicated 33 percent of its lottery and gambling proceeds to education, 31 percent to health care programs, and 3 percent to tourism promotion (3). This left less than one-third of the total revenue available for general governmental purposes.</p>
<p>States also use lotteries and gambling revenues to pay for capital projects such as building new schools or repairing roads. In fiscal year 2016, for example, Michigan used $236 million in lottery and gaming proceeds to pay for capital projects (4).</p>
<p>Overall, most states appear to be using lottery and gaming proceeds responsibly to support important state services. However, policymakers should continue to monitor how these revenues are being used so that taxpayers can be confident that their money is being put to good use.</p>
<h1 id="Huge-payout-expected-in-Pa-state-lottery"><a href="#Huge-payout-expected-in-Pa-state-lottery" class="headerlink" title="Huge payout expected in Pa. state lottery"></a>Huge payout expected in Pa. state lottery</h1><p>There’s a lot of speculation surrounding the expected huge payout in the Pennsylvania state lottery. The jackpot is now up to $418 million and is expected to continue growing until it’s won. It’s the second-largest U.S. lottery prize in history, and officials say that it’s likely to be claimed soon.</p>
<p>The odds of winning are one in more than 292 million, but that isn’t stopping people from buying tickets. In fact, the frenzy around the lottery has been so great that some stores have had to limit ticket sales because they’ve run out of stock.</p>
<p>Lottery officials aren’t releasing any information about who might have won, but they are advising everyone who purchased a ticket to check their numbers carefully. They also advise people not to come forward if they do happen to win, as there could be consequences for doing so.</p>
<p>If you’re one of the lucky ones who matched all six numbers, you’ll have a few decisions to make. You can either take the annuity option and receive payments over 29 years, or take a lump sum payment that’s worth significantly less but is paid out immediately.</p>
<p>No matter what you choose, you’re going to be life-changing rich. So break open that bottle of champagne and start dreaming about what you’ll do with your new fortune!</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-lottery-takes-in-over-1B-in-revenue"><a href="#Pennsylvania-lottery-takes-in-over-1B-in-revenue" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania lottery takes in over $1B in revenue"></a>Pennsylvania lottery takes in over $1B in revenue</h1><p>In Fiscal Year 2017-2018, the Pennsylvania Lottery hit a new milestone by earning over $1 billion in revenue for the first time since it was established in 1971. This is also a record high for any U.S. lottery.</p>
<p>The rise in popularity of Powerball and Mega Millions – both multi-state games – are responsible for much of the increase. Pennsylvanians bought over $2.5 billion in tickets during the fiscal year, with nearly 60 percent of that going towards prizes.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Lottery has contributed over $27 billion to programs that benefit senior citizens since it began operations 47 years ago. Over the past five years, it has averaged more than $1.2 billion per year in contributions to these programs.</p>
<h1 id="Winners-to-receive-about-984M-from-Pa-state-lottery"><a href="#Winners-to-receive-about-984M-from-Pa-state-lottery" class="headerlink" title="Winners to receive about $984M from Pa. state lottery"></a>Winners to receive about $984M from Pa. state lottery</h1><p>Hundreds of people across Pennsylvania are waking up a bit richer this morning, after winning a combined $984 million from the state lottery.</p>
<p>The winners ranged in age from 21 to 94, and each will take home an average of about $2.9 million. One ticket, sold in Philadelphia, matched all six numbers and is worth a staggering $489 million. That’s the largest jackpot ever won in Pennsylvania Lottery history.</p>
<p>“What a thrill it must be to become instant millionaires!” said lottery spokesperson Stephanie Sammy. “We can’t wait to meet the lucky new millionaires and see their smiles when they come to claim their prizes.”</p>
<p>Lottery officials say that winners have one year from the date of the drawing to claim their prize money. Winners are urged to sign the back of their tickets and keep them in a safe place until they can claim their prize.</p>
