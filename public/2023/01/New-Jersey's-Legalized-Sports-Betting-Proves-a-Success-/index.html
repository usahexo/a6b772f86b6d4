        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="New-Jersey’s-Legalized-Sports-Betting-Proves-a-Success"><a href="#New-Jersey’s-Legalized-Sports-Betting-Proves-a-Success" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey’s Legalized Sports Betting Proves a Success"></a>New Jersey’s Legalized Sports Betting Proves a Success</h1><p>New Jersey’s legalized sports betting has been a huge success according to recent reports. The state took in $183 million in bets in the first six months after sports betting was legalized in June, 2018. This far exceeds the original estimates of $100 million that were projected for the entire year.</p>
<p>This is good news for New Jersey, as it helps to boost the economy and generate much-needed tax revenue. In addition, it provides a new form of entertainment for residents and visitors alike.</p>
<p>Sports betting is now available at eight different locations in New Jersey, including Atlantic City and Monmouth Park. However, the popularity of sports betting means that more locations are likely to be added in the future.</p>
<p>The main beneficiaries of this legal change have been the casinos and race tracks in Atlantic City and Monmouth Park. Both establishments have seen a significant increase in business since sports betting was legalized. In particular, casino revenues are up by almost 25 percent compared to this time last year.</p>
<p>It is clear that New Jersey’s decision to legalize sports betting has been a success thus far. This is great news for the state, as it provides much-needed revenue and helps to boost tourism. It will be interesting to see how this trend continues in the coming years.</p>
<h1 id="Legalized-Athletics-Betting-Boosts-Tourism-in-New-Jersey"><a href="#Legalized-Athletics-Betting-Boosts-Tourism-in-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="Legalized Athletics Betting Boosts Tourism in New Jersey"></a>Legalized Athletics Betting Boosts Tourism in New Jersey</h1><p>In May of 2018, the Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992, thus allowing states to legalize sports betting. This move has led to increased tourism in New Jersey, as people from all over flock to the state to place bets on their favorite teams.</p>
<p>New Jersey’s Gaming Enforcement Division reports that legal sports betting generated nearly $50 million in revenue between June 14 and July 14 of this year. That’s a lot of money, and it’s only going to continue to increase as the novelty of legalized betting wears off. Not only is this good news for New Jersey’s coffers, but it’s also great news for its tourism industry.</p>
<p>Atlantic City casinos are some of the biggest benefactors of legalized sports betting. In fact, many casinos have installed new or expanded sportsbooks in order to take advantage of the influx of tourists. One such casino is Resorts Casino Hotel, which has seen a significant uptick in business since May.</p>
<p>In an interview with Reuters, Resorts’ CEO Mark Giannantonio said that the casino has experienced a “substantial increase” in visitation since PASPA was overturned. He also said that the casino has plans to expand its sportsbook operations in light of the growing demand. Clearly, legalized sports betting is good for business in New Jersey – both for the casinos and for the state as a whole.</p>
<p>It’s not just Atlantic City that’s seeing an increase in tourism; all of New Jersey is benefiting from PASPA’s repeal. The Meadowlands Racetrack, which is located in East Rutherford, NJ, reports that it has taken in over $16 million in bets since June 14th. That’s a lot of money, and it shows that people are willing to travel long distances to place bets on their favorite teams.</p>
<p>Not only is legalized sports betting good for tourism, but it’s also good for the economy as a whole. As more and more states legalize sports betting, they stand to see significant increases in revenue – revenue which can be used to fund important programs and initiatives. So far, Nevada is the only state which has seen a decline in revenue since PASPA was overturned; everyone else is reaping the benefits.</p>
<p>Legalized athletics betting is becoming more and more popular each day, and there’s no doubt that it will continue to boost tourism in New Jersey – and elsewhere – for years to come. If you want to get in on the action, be sure to visit one of New Jersey’s many casinos!</p>
<h1 id="Illegal-Gambling-Decreases-Since-the-Passage-of-New-Jersey-Athletics-Betting-Bill"><a href="#Illegal-Gambling-Decreases-Since-the-Passage-of-New-Jersey-Athletics-Betting-Bill" class="headerlink" title="Illegal Gambling Decreases Since the Passage of New Jersey Athletics Betting Bill"></a>Illegal Gambling Decreases Since the Passage of New Jersey Athletics Betting Bill</h1><p>Since the passage of a new bill legalizing sports betting in New Jersey, illegal gambling activity has decreased, state officials say.</p>
<p>According to numbers released by the state attorney general’s office, illegal gambling activity has decreased by more than $1.5 million since the bill was signed into law on June 11. In the month prior to the bill’s passage, illegal gambling activity totaled $1.7 million, but that number dropped to $200,000 in July. </p>
<p>State officials say they believe the decrease is due to the introduction of legal sports betting, which offers a more regulated and safe environment for gamblers.</p>
<p>“The legalization of sports betting in New Jersey has driven the criminal element out of the market, and we are now seeing lower levels of illegal gambling across the state,” state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said in a statement.</p>
<p>The decrease in illegal gambling is good news for New Jersey, which stands to gain millions in revenue from sports betting. The state estimates that it will bring in $15 million in its first year of operation and up to $100 million annually thereafter. </p>
<p>New Jersey is one of several states that have moved to legalize sports betting following a 2018 Supreme Court decision that struck down a federal ban on the practice.</p>
<h1 id="More-Money-Flowing-into-State-Thanks-to-Legalized-Athletics-Betting"><a href="#More-Money-Flowing-into-State-Thanks-to-Legalized-Athletics-Betting" class="headerlink" title="More Money Flowing into State Thanks to Legalized Athletics Betting"></a>More Money Flowing into State Thanks to Legalized Athletics Betting</h1><p>Politicians in states around the US are looking to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on the activity. The extra money flowing into state coffers is a welcome development, as many of these states are facing budget shortfalls.</p>
<p>In New Jersey, which led the charge in fighting for legalized sports betting, officials are expecting to bring in an additional $100 million per year in revenue. That’s on top of the $130 million that was already generated by Atlantic City’s casinos and racetracks.</p>
<p>The money is coming in from all over: In Pennsylvania, $16 million has been generated in just the first two months since legalization took effect. And in Mississippi, where gambling is already widespread, sports betting is expected to bring in an extra $40 million per year.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers are hailing the additional revenue as a vindication of their policies. “We’ve always said that lotteries and casinos were about much more than just creating jobs and economic development; they were also about finding new ways to fund state government,” said Missouri House Speaker Todd Richardson.</p>
<p>Democrats have been more circumspect, noting that the new revenues will come at the expense of poor people who are more likely to bet on sports. But they haven’t been able to resist cashing in themselves: In Illinois, lawmakers have proposed a statewide sports betting lottery that would generate an estimated $200 million per year.</p>
<p>The money is sorely needed: Many states are facing budget shortfalls due to lower-than-expected tax revenues and increased spending on programs like Medicaid. Sports betting provides a new source of revenue that can help alleviate some of these problems.</p>
<p>It also has the potential to create new jobs: In Connecticut, for example, officials are hoping to attract casinos and other gambling businesses in order to create thousands of new positions.</p>
<p>Legalized sports betting is a win-win for states: It brings in much-needed revenue while also creating jobs. Politicians would be wise to get on board and legalize it nationwide.</p>
<h1 id="Large-Sports-Gambling-Agencies-Moving-Into-New-Jersey-to-Take-Advantage-of-New-Legislation"><a href="#Large-Sports-Gambling-Agencies-Moving-Into-New-Jersey-to-Take-Advantage-of-New-Legislation" class="headerlink" title="Large Sports Gambling Agencies Moving Into New Jersey to Take Advantage of New Legislation"></a>Large Sports Gambling Agencies Moving Into New Jersey to Take Advantage of New Legislation</h1><p>On Monday, the US Supreme Court ruled that the state of New Jersey could legalize sports gambling, striking down a 1992 federal law that had prohibited it. This decision opens up the possibility for other states to follow suit and create their own legislation regulating sports gambling.</p>
<p>In anticipation of this ruling, several large sports gambling agencies have already begun setting up shop in New Jersey. These agencies are looking to take advantage of the new legislation and become the go-to providers of sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>One such agency is DraftKings, which has already opened a new office in Atlantic City. In a statement, the company said that it was looking forward to offering its services to New Jersey residents. Another agency, Paddy Power Betfair, has also announced its plans to expand into New Jersey.</p>
<p>The legalization of sports gambling is expected to be a boon for the economy of New Jersey. In addition to creating new jobs in the casino industry, it is also likely to generate tax revenue for the state government. Estimates put the amount of revenue at around $100 million per year.</p>
<p>This ruling is sure to have a wide-ranging impact on the US sports landscape. The major professional leagues, such as the NFL and NBA, have long been opposed to legalized sports gambling, fearing that it would compromise the integrity of their games. Now that this obstacle has been removed, they may be forced to reconsider their stance.</p>
